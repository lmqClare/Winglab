	     <h2>Design and research of resonant beam charging</h2>
			  <p style="FONT-SIZE: 17pt;FONT-FAMILY: 华文行楷"> 
			  <div class="us-post-content">
			   <li>Wireless charging technology liberates the mobile electronic device users from carrying complicated data lines and finding fixed charging sources, but the technology has the disadvantages of short transmission distance and small transmission power,Therefore, users can not fully meet the needs of their equipment convenient and efficient charging. Resonant beam charging has the characteristics of good directivity and high power of the resonant beam. It provides mobile efficient charging for electronic equipment.On the basis of solid theory, this project builds an optical experimental platform, uses resonant beam to realize wireless charging of the equipment, analyzes the charging efficiency in detail, and optimizes the experimental framework, Furthermore, the resonant beam can be used for the safety, high-efficiency and mobile charging of the electronic equipment.</li>
