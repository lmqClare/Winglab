			  <div class="us-post-content">
			   <li>Hololens is an augmented reality display device introduced in 2015 by Microsoft.
			   It has adopted the most advanced technology in the AR field and has a high level of integration. 
			   This project for Hololens equipment, put forward a set of work in lossless wireless data transmission scheme with low latency of the platform windows,
			   Hololens aims to achieve high quality real-time interactive, immersive real augmented reality experience. 
			   Experiments have proved that this scheme can achieve good results in different network environments. It provides a solid technical support for developing real-time and high-quality AR interaction on Hololens.</li>

		   <h2>Design and research of distributed laser charging</h2>
			  <p style="FONT-SIZE: 17pt;FONT-FAMILY: 华文行楷"> 
			  <div class="us-post-content">
			   <li>Wireless charging technology liberates the mobile electronic device users from carrying complicated data lines and finding fixed charging sources, but the technology has the disadvantages of short transmission distance and small transmission power,
Therefore, users can not fully meet the needs of their equipment convenient and efficient charging. Distributed laser charging has the characteristics of good directivity and high power of the laser. It provides mobile efficient charging for electronic equipment.
On the basis of solid theory, this project builds an optical experimental platform, uses distributed laser to realize wireless charging of the equipment, analyzes the charging efficiency in detail, and optimizes the experimental framework,
Furthermore, the laser can be used for the safety, high-efficiency and mobile charging of the electronic equipment.</li>
